# Celo-Project
I have created a TestNG framework using selenium and Java.

Need to add JRE Libraries(jar files), Selenium Libraries(jar files) and TestNG Libraries(jar files) in Eclipse 

You can run the project in two ways.

Either CeloAuto.java(Run as TestNG Test) or testng.xml(Run as TestNG Suite)

Result can be viewed in Result of running suite(TestNG)
